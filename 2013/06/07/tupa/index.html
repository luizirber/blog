    <h1>I finally met Tupã</h1>

    <time class="single" datetime="2013-06-07T23:45:00-03:00">07 Jun 2013</time>

    <p>So, after two and a half years, I finally met <a href="http://supercomputacao.inpe.br/recursos2">Tupã</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luizirber/sets/72157633820118765/"><img class="center" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/8896385074_5a48573f57.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a></p>
<p>Curiously, it was only after I left INPE. <a href="http://ciclotux.blogspot.com">Arnaldo</a> came to Cachoeira
to visit us and I planned to show him the center, but I wasn't expecting
to do the whole tour. When I began working there they only showed the
public part, because Tupã was off-limits at that time, and I thought it
still was since then. Well, me and everybody else that got into the group
after me... We went on a small tour to see Tupã, the engines, no-breaks
and all the electrical installation needed to support the building.</p>
<p>And it was <strong>AMAZING!</strong> I always liked more software than hardware, but it
is awesome to see things that you just knew from a SSH session. I could see
the tape library, disk arrays, the blinkenlights... It is in some ways the
physical manifestation of your code, or at least you have a better notion
of how many things are in motion when you execute something on the computer.</p>
<p>All in all, good times. It wasn't exactly what I expected at first, but I
made some great friends there, I could bike to work everyday, and I
learned (by trial and error) that you need to choose better who do you
trust. So it goes.</p>
