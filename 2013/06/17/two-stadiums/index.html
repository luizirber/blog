    <h1>A Tale of Two Stadiums</h1>

    <time class="single" datetime="2013-06-17T22:00:00-03:00">17 Jun 2013</time>

    <p>Last weekend I went with some friends to Maracanã watch Italy vs Mexico
at the first round of the Confederations Cup.
We got some cheap tickets (R$ 57, about US$ 25) on an area meant for
Brazilians only (and that's why they were so cheap, usually tickets cost
at least double). And it was so good to go again to a stadium, it's a very
different experience from watching a game on TV, where the camera give you
a limited perspective. Our seats were behind one of the goals, and we were
lucky: we saw two goals on our side, one from Mexico (a penalty kick) and
one from Italy, a beautiful goal by Balotelli, who was a bit of a diva, by
the way, always complaining and making drama.</p>
<p>It was the third time I went to a stadium. Previous ones were Grêmio matches,
one versus River Plate in 2002 and other versus Figueirense in 2008. These
games were on Grêmio's last stadium, Olímpico Monumental, which gave way to
a new one, the Arena, built at the entrance of the city (and far from the
old one). This is happening a lot around here, given that next year we have
the World Cup and there are at least ten new stadiums built or reformed for
the competition. At first they should have been prepared with private
funding, but as time passed and they were all late public funding came into
the picture, and only in Maracanã more than one billion brazilian reais were
spent.</p>
<p>They are now much closer to developed countries' stadiums, like those we used
to see on TV. By brazilian standards they aren't even stadiums anymore,
looking more like theaters, were you just sit and watch the game. It
shouldn't be bad, but I couldn't avoid a comparison between this weekend
game and my previous experience. OK, this time the crowd didn't have a
prefered side and so it wasn't cheering up as much as I saw before, but it
was worrisome because it was obvious that almost everyone at the match was
people that could pay for the expensive tickets, and sometimes didn't even
have a strong connection with football, something that always gave a match
that catarsis aura.</p>
<p>Last week I tried to go with my family to see the new Grêmio stadium and we
weren't so lucky. Cheapest tickets cost almost R$ 100 each, and for the four
of us this meant R$ 400 less, not out of league but way too expensive. This
high cost ticket means the usual fan can't go to the stadium anymore,
and is replaced by this new fan, a consumer above everything else. And
maybe it's just a romantic vision, and of course there were a lot of problems
before, but the price paid for comfort might be too expensive in the long run.</p>
