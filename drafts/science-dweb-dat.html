    <h1>Science and the decentralized web - Managing signature collections using dat</h1>

    <time class="single" datetime="2018-08-02T12:00:00-03:00">02 Aug 2018</time>

    <p>dat is pretty exciting because the main use case, easily sharing files with
other people, fits very well in a scientific workflow. On top of that,
the <a href="https://www.beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker browser</a> is a nice demo of what a browser with dat built-in looks
like, and it's pretty cool to have easy forking and editing of websites (with
integrated versioning and everything).</p>
<p>For this PoC I want to use the same UI for drag and dropping sequence data and
calculating the signatures, but allow the user to save the signatures in a dat
archive. This is similar to how <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter">Fritter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client">Rotonde</a> save the user
profiles, and it's nice because it allows a separation between the UI and the
data (so when new updates to the UI are available, the data still works just
fine). The alternative would be to put everything in the same dat archive, but
then users would need to 'upgrade' the dat archive themselves when new UI
versions are available.</p>
<h2>How did it go?</h2>
<p>My initial plan was to run it all thru Beaker, but due to wasm-bindgen using
the BigInt JS spec and electron 2.x (a Beaker dependency) being on Chromium 61
I can't test it there yet...
<sup id=sf-science-dweb-dat-1-back><a href=#sf-science-dweb-dat-1 class=simple-footnote title="I even tried to cross my fingers and build Beaker with electron 3 (currently on beta), but wouldn't be that useful because electron 3 is at Chromium 66...">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Trying to do something on a regular browser it is, then. Turns out that <a href="https://github.com/datproject/dat-js/issues/5">dat-js</a>
is out of date and there is no clear way to use <code>dat</code> (there are suggestions for
using <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/issues/166">hyperdrive</a> directly, but it needs a <code>dat-gateway</code> to be able to
access the network, which is clumsy and kind of defeats the purpose of the
no-server part). There is a <a href="https://blog.datproject.org/2018/05/14/dat-shopping-list/">good demo</a> showing how to do that, but at this
point I think I'll let the idea floating some more and wait for a newer Chromium
on Beaker.</p><section class=footnotes><hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><ol><li id=sf-science-dweb-dat-1><p>I even tried to cross my fingers and build Beaker with electron 3
